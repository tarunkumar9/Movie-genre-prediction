With the flourish of the web, online review is becoming a more and more useful and important information resource for people. As a result, automatic review mining and summarizing has become a hot research topic recently. “Text Classification” is one of the most important NLP tasks. It is the process of classifying text strings or documents into different categories, based upon the contents of the strings. Some examples of text classification are: Understanding audience sentiment from social media, Detection of spam and non-spam emails, Auto tagging of customer queries, and Classifying blog posts into different categories. This project focuses on specific domain – Movie Reviews. A multi-knowledge based approach is used, which integrates statistical analysis and movie knowledge. The dataset used in this project is Movie Review Dataset, which is retrieved from the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The dataset is comprised of thousands of positive and negative movie reviews. The dataset is cleaned up and pre-processed in several ways like all reviews in dataset are converted to English language. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the multi-knowledge based approach in movie review mining and summarizing. Thus enabling the audience to have a clear and summarized end review of the movie.
